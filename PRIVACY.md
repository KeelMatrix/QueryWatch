# Privacy Policy

This template includes a minimal telemetry implementation so that authors can understand how their packages are used. The default implementation sends two events: **Activation** (emitted the first time a project uses the library) and **Heartbeat** (a weekly ping indicating the library is still in use). These events contain anonymized data about version and environment (operating system and .NET runtime), but never send personally identifiable information. Telemetry is **opt‑out by default**: users can disable it entirely by setting the environment variable `\KeelMatrix.QueryWatch_NO_TELEMETRY=1` before running their application. This file provides a stub; you should update it to reflect your actual telemetry endpoints, data collection policies, and data retention practices once your project is implemented. Never collect secrets, user content, or any sensitive data. Respect your users’ privacy.
